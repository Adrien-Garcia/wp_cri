<h3>Une faille critique dévoilée dans WordPress</h3>
<p>La semaine dernière, le petit monde de WordPress était en ébullition devant l&rsquo;annonce tonitruante d&rsquo;une nouvelle faille importante. <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/une-faille-critique-devoilee-dans-wordpress-39810019.htm\">La presse spécialisée</a> s&rsquo;est même engouffrée dans cette brèche grande ouverte.</p>
<blockquote><p>Il s’agit peut-être de <a title=\"\" href=\"http://klikki.fi/adv/wordpress.html\" target=\"_blank\">la pire vulnérabilité de l’application</a> de ces cinq dernières années, car celle-ci offre le moyen à un pirate d’attaquer les visiteurs d’un site sous WordPress (les versions 3.0 à 3.9.2 ; <strong>la 4.0  n’est pas concernée</strong>).</p></blockquote>
<p>Déjà, premier constat, si votre site est à jour, vous  ne risquez rien, puisque la dernière version 4.0 n&rsquo;est pas concernée&#8230; Mais en lisant plus attentivement on voit que :</p>
<blockquote><p>Pour s’exécuter l’attaque a besoin du plugin WP-Statistics. Cette extension permet d’injecter du JavaScript dans les commentaires,</p></blockquote>
<p>A la lecture de cet article on peut penser que WordPress n&rsquo;est pas totalement en cause&#8230; mais qu&rsquo;une fois de plus une extension est la vraie source du problème&#8230; mais pas forcément.<a href=\"http://blog.secupress.fr/wordpress-vulnerable-depuis-4-ans-326.html\"> Julio décrypte tout cela</a>.</p>
<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Il faut donc retenir que la mise à jour de WordPress, des thèmes et des extensions est d&rsquo;une importance capitale</span>.</p>

Sur un fond postsoviétique, meublé de béton, de passages souterrains et câbles électriques pondus partout comme des guirlandes de Noël, la communauté WordPress s’est réunie autour d’un idéalisme le plus postmoderne : l’économie de l&rsquo;open source.</p>
<p>Ça peut paraître réducteur, mais il y a tout pour résumer les préoccupations de cette communauté et la diversité des sujets présentés le long du week-end.</p>
<p><strong>Économie </strong>: Comment construisons-nous nos entreprises ? Comment nous nous professionnalisons ? Comment réaliser une croissance ? Comment vendre mieux ?</p>
<p><strong>Open source</strong>. Que veut dire profiter d’une chose qui par définition est gratuite ? Quelles sont nos obligations envers elle ? Comment peut-on assurer son avenir et sa bonne santé ? Comment ces idéologies sont reflétées dans nos relations professionnelles et dans la fondation même de nos entreprises ?</p>
<p>Où le regard sur la pure technique tient toujours sa place à un WordCamp, on voit nettement une tendance vers les discussions plus pragmatiques et plus humaines. Par exemple, il est intéressant de parler des fragilités du WP_Query, surtout quand illustrées comme l’a fait <a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/tom-nowell/\">Tom Nowell</a> en nous montrant l’espace disque nécessaire pour effectuer les tests unitaires. En gros, assez pour causer la destruction de l’univers ! Eh oui, l’humour tient toujours sa place aussi, et ça fait du bien. Mais en plus des discours techniques tels que la migration d’un site (<a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/daniel-kanchev/\">Daniel Kanchev</a>), le protoyping interactive (<a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/karin-christen/\">Karin Christen</a>) et la nouvelle génération de stacks d’hébergement (<a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/mark-jaquith/\">Mark Jaquith</a>) ; nous avons pu réfléchir aussi sur la philosophie WordPress et à son sens pur (<a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/siobhan-mckeown/\">Siobhan McKeown</a>), la dépression dans le domaine des nouvelles technologies (<a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/yana-petrova/\">Yana Petrova</a>), et un regard au-delà du code pour étudier le workflow de notre quotidien afin d’optimiser sa productivité et son sens d’équilibre général (<a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/session/noel-tock/\">Noel Tock</a>).</p>
<p>Puis, il y avait le grand moment Q&amp;A avec Matt Mullenweg, co-fondateur de WordPress et CEO d’Automattic, modéré par Om Malik, journaliste et un des tout premiers utilisateurs WordPress. Deux sujets sortis de l’entretien ont continué à faire débat même après le WordCamp : l’image de la femme dans les nouvelles technologies (et comment celle-ci s’exprime dans la culture de différents pays – souvenez-vous du fameux post par <a href=\"http://curtismchale.ca/2013/12/09/supporting-women-wordpress/\">Vladimir Prelovac </a>?), et le souhait exprimé par Matt que les entreprises et les individus qui travaillent avec <a href=\"http://www.poststat.us/contribution-culture/\">WordPress contribuent 5%</a> de leur temps et/ou ressources à ce projet open source.</p>
<p>Alors qu’elle n’a pas de fait de vague, une question posée par <a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/2014/10/04/video-matt-mullenweg-om-malik-qa-at-wceu-2014/\">Caspar Hübinger (25 :30)</a>, était tout particulièrement pertinente pour nous, la communauté française, étendue à la communauté non anglophone dans sa globalité — sujet qu’on a pu creuser lors du &laquo;&nbsp;Contributor Day&nbsp;&raquo; le lendemain. Est-ce que chaque communauté (autour d’une langue) pourrait avoir au sein de l’écosystème WordPress son P2 (blog au format spécifique pour la gestion d’un projet) pour gérer les communications et l’organisation de sa communauté ? Et alors que Caspar espérait peut-être un retour plus profond de l’avis de Matt sur l’importance du développement des communautés non anglophone, il a néanmoins eu la réponse voulue : oui. Après tout, a dit Matt, un blog c’est gratuit.</p>
<p>Mais les P2 ce n’est que le début, et lors du Contributor Day le lundi 29, il y a eu une grande réunion des <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots</a> pour parler des changements en cours et les choses à venir.</p>
<p>Tout d’abord <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2014/09/25/since-many-of-you-will-be-at-wordcamp/\">Zé se retire de son poste</a> comme meneur du projet, et dans l’intérim c’est <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nacin\">Andrew Nacin</a> et <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/samuelsidler\">Sam Sidler</a> qui prennent le relais afin d’amener le projet vers sa prochaine itération.</p>
<p>Pour avancer dans la continuité des packs de langues qui sont désormais externalisés pour le core de WordPress, permettant de travailler les traductions indépendamment du code, ils sont en train de mettre en place cette même logique pour les plugins et pour les thèmes. Où il n’est pas raisonnable de croire pouvoir tout traduire (presque 34 000 plugins et 3 000 thèmes), l’équipe va choisir les 25 plugins les plus populaires du dépôt pour commencer. C’est ambitieux, certes, et ça va demander la mobilisation de chaque communauté pour y arriver, mais quel bel objectif d’imaginer chercher et trouver des thèmes et des modules externes dans sa langue maternelle !</p>
<p>Au mois de mai, il y a eu des <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2014/05/25/quick-recap/\">objectifs définis pour les sites Rosettas</a> (versions traduites de WordPress.org), ainsi qu’une proposition pour l’implémentation de leur règlementation. Et alors que pas grande chose s’est passé depuis, on n’a qu’à <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org\">regarder le site français</a> pour comprendre le travail à faire : forums externalisés, blog post qui date de 2007, instructions d’installation obsolètes, pas de showcase—et c’est le cas pour beaucoup de communautés.</p>
<p>En plus des P2 évoqués par Caspar, chaque communauté aura également droit aux forums d’entraide sur son site Rosetta. A priori ceci tient de peu (l’implémentation de la nouvelle version de BBPress et son thème), et certaines communautés, telle que la communauté néerlandaise, ont déjà leur forum. Ils nous ont aussi promis accès à un showcase, pour présenter les plus beaux exemples de sites WordPress des pays francophones. Nacin a également évoqué de nouveaux outils pour aider les modérateurs et validateurs à gérer le public, tel que le renvoi automatique d’une question support sur un P2 vers les forums, et la modération de commentaires pour des utilisateurs qui publient pour la première fois afin d’éviter des spams.</p>
<p>Pour un WordCamp Europe qui a compté 14 anglophones parmi les 31 orateurs, dont 9 américains, il est peut-être difficile de croire que WordPress se soucie des communautés « étrangères ». Pourtant, ils nous citent avec fierté que désormais <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simond/status/519022106223603712\">les téléchargements du logiciel gratuit depuis les sites Rosettas sont le double du nombre de téléchargements en VO</a>. Impressionnant.</p>
<p>Historiquement, chaque communauté WordPress non anglophone s’est débrouillée pour offrir un support à ses membres (forums), pour le tenir au courant des nouveautés du milieu (blogs) et pour tenir un discours marketing qui montre une belle face et nous aide à valoriser cette solution sur nos marchés respectifs (showcases, experts, conférences). Mais faire tout seul veut dire ne pas faire partie véritable de la communauté internationale. Cette image fragmentée nous fait travailler d’autant plus pour justifier notre cause : WordPress comme solution même dans les entreprises, et notre communauté comme joueur majeur dans le monde.</p>
<p>Désormais, nous aurions les moyens de propulser les efforts de notre communauté, grâce aux outils fournis et maintenus par WordPress et la cohésion qui viendrait d’une image de marque commune sur laquelle chacun peut s’appuyer. Et avec cette base unie et fortifiée, on peut espérer davantage attirer du monde d’y participer et d’y contribuer. Parce que c’est grâce à nos membres si WordPress existe en français ; c’est grâce à nos membres s’il existe autant de tutoriels en français ; c’est grâce à nos membres si on a de si beaux exemples de sites qui tournent sous WordPress. Une communauté ne peut pas se reposer sur les épaules de quelques-uns, elle demande que chacun contribue, ne serait-ce qu’un minimum.</p>
<p>Au Contributor Day on nous rappelle que contribuer à sa communauté n’est qu’une question de coder (mais que ça fait plaisir de voir les français sur la liste des contributeurs au core !). Cela signifie aussi traduire, documenter, répondre aux questions dans les forums, faire les retours d’expériences, créer et participer aux Meetups locaux et toujours viser à professionnaliser et à valoriser WordPress, surtout pour ceux qui vivent de lui comme beaucoup d’entre nous.</p>

  <p><strong>Voici le d&eacute;but du contenu :</strong> A mon tour &eacute;galement de faire un retour d&rsquo;exp&eacute;rience sur le WP Tech 2014. Le concept Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, j&rsquo;ai organis&eacute; avec 3 autres personnes la 1&egrave;re &eacute;dition du WP Tech &agrave; Nantes le 29 Novembre dernier (avec Willy Bahuaud, Simon Janin et St&eacute;phanie Vachon). Il s&rsquo;agissait du premier &eacute;v&egrave;nement fran&ccedil;ais ax&eacute; sur les aspects techniques de WordPress. 140 personnes &eacute;taient pr&eacute;sentes, avec pas moins de 12 orateurs diff&eacute;rents sur une journ&eacute;e. Il y avait du monde au WP Tech &laquo;&nbsp;&Eacute;puisant&nbsp;&raquo; est le premier terme qui me vient en t&ecirc;te quand je repense &agrave; cette journ&eacute;e, le second est &laquo;&nbsp;encourageant&nbsp;&raquo;, et le troisi&egrave;me est tout simplement &laquo;&nbsp;Merci&nbsp;&raquo;. La 1&egrave;re &eacute;dition &eacute;tait loin d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre parfaite. On a eu quelques petits d&eacute;fauts et couacs, notamment la vid&eacute;o ou encore le manque de Cookies le midi (bande de gros mangeurs). Mais dans l&rsquo;ensemble, les retours sont vraiments positifs, et cela fait tr&egrave;s plaisir de voir que notre &eacute;v&egrave;nement a su trouver tout de suite son public. Mais je ne suis pas l&agrave; pour vous faire un &eacute;ni&egrave;me retour sur la journ&eacute;e en elle-m&ecirc;me. Si vous voulez un retour officiel, lisez notre article officiel sur le bilan du WP Tech&hellip;</p>

<p>Although I find it hard to believe that any of our regular readers are unfamiliar with WordCamp (come on, now!), for those of you that are completely green: WordCamps are events held all over the world! The events are an awesome place where WordPress nerds unite to share their skills, insights, and learn a whole lot from a bunch of other smarties.</p>
<p><strong><a href=\"http://2015.maui.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Maui</a> is on February 13-14th</strong>; it’s the first WordCamp Maui to take place, although it has been long in the works, and thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jb510\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Brown</a>, it’s finally taking place.</p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10552 \" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/itsallhappening.png\" alt=\"almost famous it\'s all happening webdevstudios, wordcamp, wordcamp maui, gregg franklin, jon brown, tracy apps, jack lenox\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" /></p>
<p><strong>The WDS team will have one of our own in attendance: Developer lead <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benlobaugh\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Lobaugh</a> will be speaking!</strong> Details on the when and what are still to be determined, and we will update with more information once we have it (you can also always keep an eye on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/webdevstudios\" target=\"_blank\">our Twitter feed</a> for updates).</p>
<p>Other than that, though, we wanted to highlight a few other people and sessions that you won’t want to miss:</p>
<p><span id=\"more-10551\"></span></p>
<p><b>Friday Notables</b></p>
<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreggFranklin\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Franklin</a> is a WordPress Developer, team member at <a href=\"http://www.serverpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">ServerPress, LLC</a>. (the creators of DesktopServer), and co-facilitator of the Inland Empire WordPress meetup group. He will be with a team that is presenting two workshops&#8211;one for beginners, and one for business. Gregg will be the “opening act” with the beginner workshop, so go see his song and dance and get your beginner knowledge on!</p>
<p><strong>The Intro to WordPress workshop will be on Friday from 9:00 AM &#8211; 10:35 AM</strong>, and will focus on helping attendees understand WordPress while building and managing their website(s). Gregg will cover everything from initially setting up your WordPress site to managing and publishing posts (including adding categories and tagging content). Attendees can expect to learn the entire Dashboard, as well as handy tricks and tips.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of the day, there will also be the following workshops:</p>
<ul>
<li>10:45 AM &#8211; 12:00 PM &#8211; Intro to WordPress Themes &#8211; <em>Instructor: Adam Silver</em></li>
<li>1:00 PM &#8211; 2:00 PM &#8211; Passionate About Plugins &amp; Wild For Widgets &#8211; <em>Instructor: Kathryn Presner</em></li>
<li>2:00 PM &#8211; 3:15 PM &#8211; Hosting and Security &#8211; <em>Instructor: Ben Howard</em></li>
<li>3:25 PM &#8211; 4:00 PM &#8211; Panel discussion/Q&amp;A &#8211; <em>Guided by YOUR questions after a day full of WP goodness!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Saturday Notables</b></p>
<p><i>Session descriptions from the <a href=\"http://2015.maui.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WC Maui website</a></i></p>
<p>These have been picked out by a few of our developers as sessions that piqued <i>their</i> interest, so make room in your schedule:</p>
<p><b>9:00 AM &#8211; How To Not Design Like A Developer </b>- <i>Speaker: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tapps\" target=\"_blank\">Tracy Apps</a></i></p>
<p>Have you developed enough WordPress skills to make your own custom themes, but they still look like crap? Don’t worry, there’s some simple steps and tools that can help you design less like a developer. Come with your questions, leave with concrete examples and tools to use right away… and designers everywhere will thank you.</p>
<p><b>9:50 AM &#8211; Building themes with the WP REST API </b>- <i>Speaker: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacklenox\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Lenox</a></i></p>
<p>With the REST API shortly due to be merged into WordPress core, it’s about time developers started thinking about building themes that use it. The REST API allows developers to create much more engaging user experiences. This will be a talk that covers the challenges one faces when working with the REST API, how to extend the REST API itself from within your theme, and suggested ways that themes can be built to use it.</p>
<p><b>Lastly…</b></p>
<p>For those of you who will be there, the WordCamp Maui folks shared a wonderful post on how to <a href=\"http://2015.maui.wordcamp.org/2015/02/05/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-workcamp-maui-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">make the most of the event</a>. There’s some excellent advice in there that isn’t only applicable to WC Maui; if you’re a regular conference/event goer (or would like to become one), I bet you&#8217;ll find something good to take away from it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you haven’t already scored yourself a ticket, you might have to miss this one; it seems that this WC Maui is <a href=\"http://2015.maui.wordcamp.org/2015/02/03/wordcamp-maui-is-sold-out/\" target=\"_blank\">sold out</a>. You can always keep an eye on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampMaui\" target=\"_blank\">their Twitter</a>, though, for any updates on tickets that are being resold.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure to say hi to Ben</strong>, and tell us how it went when it&#8217;s over!</p>

<p>I used to think that the only jobs for women included only nursing, teaching, or being a mother. I had no clue that there would be something called the Internet, and that I would be making websites for it and teaching others how to code. Since its inception, the technology fields have always been <a href=\"http://www.ncwit.org/blog/did-you-know-demographics-technical-women\" target=\"_blank\">under-represented by women</a>, and there is a lack of positive female role models in the computer and IT Industry as a whole. One place where the balance is more equal is within the WordPress Community.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-10497\"></span></p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10499\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kim-wcsf.png\" alt=\"kim-wcsf\" width=\"801\" height=\"316\" /></p>
<p>The WordPress Community is comprised of many different people across all backgrounds who also happen to be positive role models for their work with WP. One such woman was <a href=\"http://wpmom.org\" target=\"_blank\">Kim Parsell</a>, who was actively contributing to and involved with multiple WordPress efforts, including the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/docs\" target=\"_blank\">documentation team</a>. Unfortunately, we were robbed of Kim’s contributions too soon as she recently passed away unexpectedly.</p>
<p>I created the <a href=\"http://wpmom.org\" target=\"_blank\">wpmom.org</a> website to remember her and her contributions to the community. Along with the many <a href=\"http://wpmom.org/tribute-links/\" target=\"_blank\">individual posts</a> by many members in the WordPress community, she has received public recognition from the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-creates-a-traveling-scholarship-in-memory-of-kim-parsell\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org Foundation</a> in the form of a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2015/01/16/remembering-kim/\" target=\"_blank\">yearly travel scholarship</a> given in her name. Thanks to that scholarship, each year, one woman has the opportunity to participate in the largest <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp</a> in the United States. Kim was very passionate about involving women in WordPress, so this scholarship was set up to pay tribute to her by encouraging more women to participate in the community.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Overall, the WordPress community is one of the most women-friendly tech communities around.</strong> WordPress meetups and WordCamps are usually at least 30-40% women, and I&#8217;ve not found that to be the case at any other tech conference or meetup. Outside the WordPress community, I attended a dev conference once with 200 attendees, 5 of whom were women. It&#8217;s not at all uncommon for me to be the only woman in attendance at tech meetups.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/nataliemac/\" target=\"_blank\">Natalie MacLees</a> is also another very inspirational woman in the WordPress Community. In addition to running her own WordPress development agency, she is also founder of the <a href=\"http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/los-angeles\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Develop It! Los Angeles Chapter</a>, whose mission is, “Empowering women of diverse backgrounds from around the world to learn how to develop software.” Natalie has also been the main organizer for the last two annual <a href=\"http://2014.la.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles WordCamps</a>, and she has run the largest WordPress Meetup group in Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://socalwp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SoCal WordPress</a>, for nearly six years. She is a frequent speaker at WordPress and jQuery events, and she has also authored two editions of the popular book, <em><a href=\"http://jqueryfordesignersbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery for Designers</a></em>.</p>
<p>According to Natalie, <strong>“Empowerment means feeling capable and confident in your own skills and ability to get things done and achieve goals. It means feeling that you control your own destiny.”</strong></p>
<p>She also feels that there are both internal and external barriers to making women feel more empowered in the WordPress Community:</p>
<blockquote><p>Internally, women need help owning their accomplishments and speaking about them without diminishing them or apologizing for them. That&#8217;s something we can all work on. <strong>Personally, I&#8217;ve stopped saying &#8216;sorry&#8217; when I haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, and have forbidden myself from using the words like ‘but’, &#8216;just&#8217;, or &#8216;only&#8217; when speaking about my own accomplishments.</strong> When you say things like &#8216;It was <i>just</i> a simple plugin,&#8217; or &#8216;It was <i>only</i> a beginner&#8217;s book,&#8217; you belittle your achievement in your own mind and in the mind of whomever you&#8217;re speaking to.</p>
<p>Externally, we need to be aware of discrimination. The WordPress community as a whole is very open and welcoming, and there is a <a href=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct for WordCamps</a>, but there are occasional incidents victimizing both men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Even something that seems small or minor can have a big impact on an individual. If a speaker is discriminated against or harassed on their first or second attempt at presenting, they may never attempt to present again. </strong></p>
<p>We need to have open ears and open minds to hear about these things and the impact they can have. It&#8217;s not uncommon for women to be dismissed or discredited when they speak out about incidents where they felt uncomfortable or humiliated. <strong>We need to stop doing that and really listen and look at where we can make changes.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Natalie went on to say, “We should be sure that there are women in leadership positions and in speaker roles throughout the community. When other women see that, they are encouraged and think that it&#8217;s something they can do, too. I think the relatively high proportion of women is a really positive reflection on the WordPress community. We&#8217;re not perfect, but we&#8217;re so far ahead of other tech and dev communities. In that regard, <strong>the WordPress community is a leader and other tech/dev communities should be looking to us to figure out how they can be more welcoming and get more women involved.”</strong></p>
<p>It is important that as a community, we continue to reach out to women to involve them and one way that this can be done is through education in offering beginning WordPress and coding classes to women to help them get a leg up on the latest web technologies.</p>

<p><strong>This past weekend, I had the opportunity to teach an <em>Introduction to WordPress </em>class to </strong>group<strong> of seventeen young women.</strong> It was a three hour <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Los-Angeles/events/218879952/\" target=\"_blank\">workshop</a> put on by <a href=\"http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/los-angeles\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Develop It!</a> at <a href=\"http://kleverdogcoworking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kleverdog Coworking</a> in Chinatown. Girl Develop It! is a national organization that specializes in teaching affordable technology courses for women, and they even have a scholarship/financial assistance available for those in need. All are welcome to attend classes as long as they abide by the <a href=\"http://www.girldevelopit.com/codeofconduct\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Develop It Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>I started by giving an overview about posts and pages, plugins, themes, settings, maintenance, and backups. We went over the <a href=\"https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/com-or-org/\" target=\"_blank\">difference between .com and .org</a>, which is a source of confusion for many beginners. The intention of this class was to introduce the WordPress concepts to class participants in hopes of getting them more involved in the community and, of course, to come back and take more advanced classes and get into WordPress web development and, eventually, contribution.</p>
<p>Organizations like Girl Develop It! are targeted at teaching women the skills they need to be competitive in today’s job market, and more classes in WordPress are becoming available as the demand for these courses increases. The WordPress Foundation has stepped up to provide scholarships for women and I hope that other organizations follow suit. WordCamps and conferences are always looking for great women speakers, and the more women speak, the more visible we will be to young women wanting to break into the web technology field.</p>
<p>If you are interested in becoming more empowered (or know a woman in your life who would love to learn!), <strong>check out my next class, <em><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Los-Angeles/events/219815521/\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to PHP and MySQL</a></em></strong> with Girl Develop It!, which starts February 14th and runs four consecutive weeks in Los Angeles. <strong>The following month (on March 14th), I will be teaching<em> <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Los-Angeles/events/218900741/\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to HTML and CSS</a>,</em> which is one of my favorite topics to teach about as it opens so many possibilities to beginners. </strong>Join us!</p>

<li>What happened to Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress?</li>
<li>Is this an actual plugin?</li>
<li>Do I need to use CMB2 instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a few of the types of questions I get asked when talking about CMB2. I agree&#8211;it IS confusing! With this post, I&#8217;m hoping to <strong>shed some light on these questions, as well as properly introduce you to CMB2, and officially announce its release from beta!</strong> In short, CMB2 is a metabox, custom fields, and forms library for WordPress much like its predecessor, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress</a> (affectionately known as CMB), but with some new bells and whistles and a new name.</p>
<p>The story goes&#8230;after having been burned by some issues with other custom field plugins, we determined it was best to stick with code that we had some control over. We fell in love with CMB because it was a library we could include in any of our projects and it would just work while letting us keep all of the field configuration in the code, and more importantly, in our version control system.</p>
<p>Quickly CMB became a large part of our process and projects at WebDevStudios, and we were actively maintaining it. We took over the CMB github repo from Jared Atchison in December of 2013. In fact, my very last post on this blog was <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2013/12/03/custom-metaboxes-and-fields-1-0-0-released/\" target=\"_blank\">about that event and the release of CMB 1.0.0</a>.<br />
<span id=\"more-10544\"></span></p>
<p><strong>CMB was (and still is) an incredible library, but it had some glaring shortcomings.</strong> The biggest issue we were beginning to bump against was the fact that only one copy of the library could/would be loaded at once. That&#8217;s not an issue until you consider the fact that one plugin&#8217;s bundled (and outdated!) version may be loaded before the bundled version in your theme or plugin. This meant that you had to plan for the lowest common denominator, which is not a long-term viable solution.</p>
<p><strong>Enter CMB2.</strong></p>
<p>After many hours of deliberation and discussion among the team at WDS, we determined it would be best to start fresh by forking CMB and creating an entirely new project that would no longer have to &#8216;care&#8217; about backwards compatibility. We accomplished this by completely renaming every class, function, hook, and filter in the library. This ensures that CMB2 will not conflict with any version of the original CMB. Of course, none of that really mattered if we couldn&#8217;t solve the core issue: version management. As a result, CMB2 was built with a new mechanism to ensure it only loads the most recent version of CMB2 in your system. This ensures that a plugin with an old bundled version will not conflict or take precendent over your up-to-date version.</p>
<p><strong>But of course we didn&#8217;t stop there.</strong></p>
<p>Since we completely re-wrote the project, and didn&#8217;t need to keep backwards-compatibility, we spent a lot of time refactoring things to make them more functional and more flexible. We made so many changes, and we changed the name to the ambigous &#8220;CMB2&#8243;, hopefully abandoning the idea that the plugin is for &#8216;metaboxes only.&#8217;</p>
<p>A few examples of creative uses of CMB2 include <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/blob/master/example-functions.php#L351-L405\" target=\"_blank\">user fields</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Using-CMB-to-create-an-Admin-Theme-Options-Page\" target=\"_blank\">options pages</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Create-New-Posts-Post-Type-Entries-Using-A-Front-End-Form\" target=\"_blank\">front-end forms</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jtsternberg/Taxonomy_MetaData\" target=\"_blank\">taxonomy metadata</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2-attached-posts\" target=\"_blank\">associating WordPress posts/pages</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/jtsternberg/Shortcode_Button\" target=\"_blank\">modals for generating shortcodes</a>. As you can see, its flexibility has outgrown its original title.</p>
<p><strong>What has changed? </strong></p>
<p>CMB2 has undergone so many changes under the hood, it&#8217;s impossible to list them all, but I&#8217;ll do my best to list a few of the notable ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMB2 is now an official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin in the WordPress plugin repository</a>, which may be a preferable solution under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>All hooks and filters have been renamed, and in some cases the parameters passed to them have changed. We&#8217;ve been working feverishly to update the wiki to ensure accuracy. Is documentation your thing? <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki\" target=\"_blank\">We could use your help</a>!</li>
<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/blob/master/example-functions.php#L406-L415\" target=\"_blank\">old method for including the CMB core files</a> is no longer applicable and you&#8217;re simply required to <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/blob/master/example-functions.php#L14\" target=\"_blank\">include it directly</a>. If you&#8217;re using the wordpress.org plugin, simply activate the plugin.</li>
<li>A few parameters in the metaboxes and fields have changed. For example, the <code>\'pages\'</code> metabox parameter has been changed to <code>\'object_types\'</code> to more accurately reflect its purpose.</li>
<li>All markup has been converted from tables to generic divs with classes. This should help tremendously with your front-end responsive styling.</li>
<li>All strings have been properly localized, and Finnish, French and Spanish translations are included. <a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/cmb2/\" target=\"_blank\">We&#8217;re on Transifex</a>, <a href=\"http://wp-translations.org/translators-wp-translations/\" target=\"_blank\">help us translate</a>?</li>
<li>Numerous UI tweaks, fixes, additions, and improvements.</li>
<li>Many new filters and actions for hooking in to CMB2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention the awesome support and community we have on github.<strong> We thank so many contributors for making CMB2 awesome and continuing to push it forward.</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2\" target=\"_blank\">Feel free to join them</a>!</p>
<p>Until today, CMB2 has been stamped with a big &#8220;beta&#8221; label as we wanted everyone to clearly understand that things could and probably would break. <strong>Now, we are officially releasing CMB2 (technically now 2.0.1), and we plan on maintaining strict backwards-compatibility going forward.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for letting me introduce you to CMB2, and I hope it becomes as invaluable a tool in your WordPress toolbox as it has ours.</p>
<p><strong>If you can&#8217;t get enough of CMB2, here are some additional resources:</strong></p>

When starting out a multilingual site, there are a number of things to consider and some important elements to keep in mind from the very early stages of the project. In this post, I’ll try and highlight just a few main things, as every site (or Multisite) installation will, of course, vary on a per project basis.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-10438\"></span></p>
<h3>Translation Lengths</h3>
<p>Typically, during the design phase the text being used will be your native language or some alternative filler text (lorem ipsum). While this is perfectly acceptable practice, one thing to keep in mind is that many languages around the world have different <a title=\"Writing Systems\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system\" target=\"_blank\">writing systems</a>. When translating a site for different languages, it’s important to think about margins and padding between elements as well as line heights.</p>
<p>Although it’s perhaps not always possible to know how long each and every word will look once it&#8217;s translated, it’s definitely something you’ll want to account for especially when space is limited. In my experience, some languages like Russian and Polish will have words that are 1½ times the amount of space as that same word written in English.</p>
<p>There are a couple of options for when these situations that come up. For example, conditionals can always be added to template files based on blog id or body classes can be added to target specific blogs if you’re doing a Multisite multilingual install. This can become overwhelming and difficult to manage for larger networks, so that’s also something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of adding a body class for sub-sites for smaller fixes:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-php\" title=\"Body Class for Subsites\">&lt;?php
/**
 * Add Body Class for Language Sites
 */
function wds_subsite_body_classes( $classes ) {
        $id = get_current_blog_id();
        $classes[] = \'site-id-\'.$id;
        return $classes;
}
add_filter( \'body_class\', \'wds_subsite_body_classes\' );</pre>
<h3>Using Plugins for Sub-site Modifications</h3>
<p>Another great process that I highly recommend for making major modification to the same template based on certain language needs is to put all site specific changes into a Plugin. Although it’s not a new process by any means, I think it’s something that can be forgotten sometimes. This helps things stay organized and your theme files will be much cleaner overall. Just make sure to add it as a plugin for each site rather than an MU plugin, as that can cause for translation headaches sometimes depending on which plugin you decide to use for generating translations.</p>
<p>As you can see in this example adding conditionals throughout the theme in various places can become very difficult to manage if they were spread throughout the theme:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-php\" title=\"Managing Conditionals for Multisite\">&lt;?php
/**
 * An example of how conditionals can become difficult 
 * to manage in large Multisite Networks
 */
global $blog_id;
if ( \'2\' === $blog_id ) {
// you see here;
} 
elseif ( \'3\' === $blog_id ) {
// more here;
} 
elseif ( \'4\' === $blog_id ) {
// much more here;
else {
// how this can get out of control quickly with lots of sites in the network;
}</pre>
<h3>Internationalization and Localization</h3>
<p>Once you’re into the development stage of a new multi-language project, you’ll want to make sure Phrases (translating Phrases is better practice than just words) are translation ready throughout the project (plugins and theme). This could be an entire post in and of it’s own, but a couple quick things to keep in mind.  For example, text domains, domain paths, basic strings, variables, plurals, and so much more. It’s all really nicely documented in the codex and developer handbooks and I highly recommend these as really good examples with solid explanations.</p>
<p><b>Codex</b></p>

</ul>
<h3>A Few Issues that can come up with Translations and Characters</h3>
<p>Some other issues that inevitably come up are often with languages with accents and different characters when translating. Recently, I came across a post by WPEngineer for character based languages and languages with accents. This <a title=\"using strlen\" href=\"http://wpengineer.com/2410/dont-use-strlen/\" target=\"_blank\">post by WPEngineer</a> does a really nice job of explaining how you can address the issue when/if it arises on a project.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, with certain character based languages, you’ll notice font rendering issues depending on which fonts you’re using on the site. There are some workarounds like declaring font weights, or if you&#8217;re using Sass, you can create a mixin along these lines:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-css\" title=\"Font Stacks for Non Multi-Language and Multi-Language sites\">// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Font Stacks for Non Multi-Language and Multi-Language sites
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Example Font Stack Usage
// @include font(light);
// @include font(normal);
// @include font(semibold);
// @include font(bold);
@mixin font($fontstack) {
    $wds_font: (
        light: \'wds_font_light\',
        normal: \'wds_font_normal\',
        semibold: \'wds_font_semibold\',
        bold: \'wds_font_bold\'
    );
    $fallback: (
        light: normal,
        normal: normal,
        semibold: bold,
        bold: bold
    );
    font-family: map-get($wds_font, $fontstack), WDS UI, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;
        html:lang(bg) &amp;, // Bulgaria
        html:lang(cs) &amp;, // Czech Republic
        html:lang(el) &amp;, // Greece
        html:lang(ko) &amp;, // Korea
        html:lang(pl) &amp;, // Poland
        html:lang(ro) &amp;, // Romania
        html:lang(ru) &amp;, // Russia
        html:lang(th) &amp;, // Thailand
        html:lang(vi) &amp;  // Vietnam
        {
            font-family: Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;
            font-weight: map-get($fallback, $fontstack);
        }
        html:lang(zh) &amp; { // China
            font-family: \'Yahei UI\', 微软雅黑, map-get($wds_font, $fontstack), sans-serif, WDS UI, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;
            font-weight: map-get($fallback, $fontstack);
        }
        html:lang(ja) &amp; { // Japan
            font-family: \'Meiryo\', map-get($wds_font, $fontstack), sans-serif, WDS UI, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;
            font-weight: map-get($fallback, $fontstack);
        }
}</pre>
<p>With International sites, it’s also good practice to be mindful of excerpt lengths. In English, having an excerpt of 55 words will look a lot different than it would in Chinese since most words are a single character. Not a deal breaker, but certainly something to keep in mind when working with different languages.</p>
<p>Social media is a huge part of most websites, but believe it or not, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter are not always the most popular networks in other countries. If we use China as an example: they use things like WeChat, Weibo, and Yammer more than Facebook or Twitter, so you’ll want to account for that when building out your theme templates, plugins, etc.</p>
<p>This really just scrapes the surface of some of the basics to keep in mind when building and working on Language Sites. There are lots of great posts with information on internationalization plugins to use, ways to generate .po/.mo files and so much more, including this fantastic <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/automating-i18n-wordpress-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">article on <em>Post Status</em></a> by Brady Vercher.</p>
<p>When building and designing sites, these are just a few pointers to keep in mind. If you have other experiences, tips or things to remember, let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>However, I do <em>not</em> like the limitations of using inline non-semantic, presentational markup to place these wonderful symbols, e.g. <pre class=\"prettyprint lang-html\" title=\"Font icon non-semantic\">&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-trash-o&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</pre></p>
<p>What if we could keep the embellishments in our stylesheet, minimize the HTML markup, and keep things a bit more semantic?</p>
<p>I think we can, and this is what we&#8217;ll accomplish in a few steps. I first came across this approach from Jayden Seric&#8217;s post, <em><a href=\"http://jaydenseric.com/blog/fun-with-sass-and-font-icons\" target=\"_blank\">Fun With Sass &amp; Font Icons</a></em>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be using the <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome</a> icon library for this example. Font Awesome offers a comprehensive library of icons, and they&#8217;re all <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/license/\" target=\"_blank\">free and GPL compatible.</a></p>
<p><span id=\"more-10449\"></span></p>
<h3>Set a Sass variable for font-family of icon font</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we want to set up a social nav, and a Search bar icon as featured on our site.<br />
<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-10452\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-15-09.51.15-1024x39.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of WDS social nav and search\" width=\"700\" height=\"27\" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll assume we already have Font Awesome enqueued properly in our WordPress theme (<a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/_s/blob/master/inc/scripts.php#L59\" target=\"_blank\">see wd_s for example</a>). First, let&#8217;s declare our Font Awesome font-family as a Sass variable:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-css\" title=\"Font Awesome as Sass font variable\">$font-icon: &quot;FontAwesome&quot;;</pre>
<h3>Sass @mixin for icon fonts</h3>
<p>We can use our newly defined <code>$font-icon</code> variable (line 18 below) within our new handy mixin to Kiss It Simple, Stupid (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\" target=\"_blank\">K.I.S.S.</a>):</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-css\" title=\"Font Awesome Icon Font mixin\">// For adding font icons to elements using CSS pseudo-elements
// http://jaydenseric.com/blog/fun-with-sass-and-font-icons
@mixin icon($position: before, $icon: false, $styles: true) {
    @if $position == both {
        $position: \'before, &amp;:after\';
    }
    // Either a :before or :after pseudo-element, or both, defaulting to :before
    &amp;:#{$position} {
        @if $icon {
            // A particular icon has been specified
            content: &quot;#{map-get($icons, $icon)}&quot;;
        }
        @if $styles {
            // Supportive icon styles required
            speak: none;
            font-style: normal;
            font-weight: normal;
            font-family: $font-icon;
        }
        // Include any extra rules supplied for the pseudo-element
        @content;
    }
}</pre>
<h3>Map Unicode Characters to Custom Aliases</h3>
<p>Now here is where it gets interesting, because typically Font Awesome gives us icon classes with unicode characters, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>.fa-search / Unicode: f002 <i class=\"fa fa-search\"></i></li>
<li>.fa-facebook / Unicode: f09a <i class=\"fa fa-facebook\"></i></li>
<li>.fa-twitter / Unicode: f099 <i class=\"fa fa-twitter\"></i></li>
<li><em>and so on</em>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>But now we can create our own mapping, and use any semantic, or non-semantic aliases:<br />
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-css\" title=\"Icon map using Font Awesome\">// Map icon names to font unicode characters
$icons: (
    search: &quot;\\f002&quot;,
    facebook: &quot;\\f09a&quot;,
    twitter: &quot;\\f099&quot;,
    // or goofy aliases, like
    magnifying-doohickey: &quot;\\f002&quot;
);</pre></p>
<p>And now we use our mixin to assign our custom <code>magnifying-doohickey</code> icon to our Search, like so:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-css\" title=\"Using font icon mixin\">[href^=&quot;#search-popup&quot;] {
    @include icon(before, magnifying-doohickey) {
        color: #b4b4b6;
        font-size: 24px;
    }
}</pre>
<p>At first, this may seem like a bit of extra overhead because you&#8217;re having to manage the font mapping. However, this opens up the ability to mix-and-match your own custom SVG icons with existing libraries, like Font Awesome. Tools like <a href=\"http://fontcustom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Custom</a> can auto-magically generate the icon mapping for you.</p>
<p>How often do we see icons that do not align with their contextual information, like the bullhorn icon sitting next to &#8220;Contact&#8221; in a main navigation?<br />
<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10459\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-15-11.26.31.png\" alt=\"screenshot of icon navigation\" width=\"349\" height=\"107\" /></p>
<p>Now we can map an alias so in our project we can use <code>@include icon(before, contact);</code> instead of <code>@include icon(before, bullhorn);</code>, or better yet put it all in an @each loop</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-css\" title=\"Custom unicode mapping for Font Awesome\">$icons: (
    // Font Awesome\'s .fa-user
    about: &quot;\\f007&quot;,
    // Font Awesome\'s .fa-bullhorn
    contact: &quot;\\f0a1&quot;,
    // Font Awesome\'s .fa-newspaper-o
    news: &quot;\\f1ea&quot;,
);</pre>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-css\" title=\"@each loop for Font Awesome icons\">@each $nav-item in about, news, contact {
    &amp; &gt; li.#{$nav-item} &gt; a {
        @include icon(before, #{$nav-item});
    }
}</pre>
<p>I find this easier to manage in the long run, and hope you find it useful!</p>

In this post, we’re going to include simple scripts for you to add to your existing theme to help make it easy to add a filterable portfolio to your project.</p>
<p><strong>Tools you’ll need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a>, installed and ready to go</li>
<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack by WordPress.com</a> plugin installed and activated</li>
<li><a href=\"http://isotope.metafizzy.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Isotope</a> for filtering</li>
</ul>
<p><span id=\"more-10509\"></span></p>
<p><strong>Notes on Isotope:</strong></p>
<p>The great thing about Isotope is that it is GPL licensed for Open Source projects. However, if your site is a commercial project, I would highly recommend purchasing a commercial license. This will help the developer to continue to support Isotope.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is setup Jetpack and enable the &#8216;Portfolio Custom Content Type&#8217;. To do this, while in your WordPress dashboard, go to <code>Jetpack &gt; Settings</code> and activate the ‘Custom Content Type’ module.</p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-10511\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jetpack-settings-1024x631.png\" alt=\"jetpack-settings\" width=\"700\" height=\"431\" /></p>
<p>Next, we need to make sure your theme supports the Portfolio Custom Content Type. To do this, we need to add the following code to your theme, during <code><a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/_s/blob/master/functions.php#L23\" target=\"_blank\">after_setup_theme</a></code>:</p>
<p><code>add_theme_support( \'jetpack-portfolio\' );</code></p>
<p>Once that is added, you’ll see that a new menu item has been added to your WordPress dashboard:</p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10513\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/portfolio-menu-item.png\" alt=\"portfolio-menu-item\" width=\"508\" height=\"595\" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>We’ll need to <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script\" target=\"_blank\">properly enqueue</a> all needed files for your theme. You can add this to wherever your theme is already enqueuing files.</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-php\" title=\"Enqueuing Isotope\">wp_register_script( \'wds-isotope\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/js/isotope.pkgd.min.js\', array( \'jquery\' ), $version, true );
wp_register_script( \'wds-portfolio\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/js/wds-portfolio.js\', array( \'jquery\' ), $version, true );
if ( is_page_template( \'homepage-template.php\' ) ) {
    wp_enqueue_script( \'wds-isotope\' );
    wp_enqueue_script( \'wds-portfolio\' );
}</pre>
<p>Notice that we are using a conditional to only enqueue our scripts on any page using our &#8216;homepage-template.php&#8217; page template. This is so that we are not enqueuing our JS files site wide. Now that they have been enqueued, <a href=\"http://isotope.metafizzy.co/\" target=\"_blank\">download Isotope</a> and add it to your theme&#8217;s JavaScript folder. Make sure this folder is named &#8216;js&#8217;. If not, you&#8217;ll need to update the above script and change the location of where it is being enqueued. Once you have added the Isotope file to your JS folder, create a new file and name it &#8216;wds-portfolio.js&#8217;. Add the following jQuery code and save the file into your &#8216;js&#8217; folder.</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-js\" title=\"Filterable portfolio jQuery\">/**
 * Portfolio functions
 */
( function( $ ) {
     $( window ).load( function() {
        // Portfolio filtering
        var $container = $( \'.portfolio\' );
        $container.isotope( {
            filter: \'*\',
            layoutMode: \'fitRows\',
            resizable: true, 
          } );
        // filter items when filter link is clicked
        $( \'.portfolio-filter li\' ).click( function(){
            var selector = $( this ).attr( \'data-filter\' );
                $container.isotope( { 
                    filter: selector,
                } );
          return false;
        } );
    } );
} )( jQuery );</pre>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have enqueued your files, let&#8217;s create a page template that is specific for your portfolio, and one to show everything on the homepage.</p>
<p>Create a new file and name it &#8216;homepage-template.php&#8217;. Copy and paste the following code:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-php\" title=\"Filterable Portfolio Page Template\">&lt;?php
/*
 * Template Name: Homepage Template
 *
 * @package wds_portfolio
*/
get_header();
?&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;page&quot; class=&quot;hfeed site&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot; class=&quot;site-main&quot;&gt;
        &lt;?php if ( ! get_theme_mod( \'wds_portfolio_hide_portfolio_page_content\' ) ) : ?&gt;
            &lt;?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;
                &lt;?php the_title( \'&lt;header class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;page-title&quot;&gt;\', \'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/header&gt;\' ); ?&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;page-content&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;?php
                        the_content();
                        wp_link_pages( array(
                            \'before\'      =&gt; \'&lt;div class=&quot;page-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;page-links-title&quot;&gt;\' . __( \'Pages:\', \'wds_portfolio\' ) . \'&lt;/span&gt;\',
                            \'after\'       =&gt; \'&lt;/div&gt;\',
                            \'link_before\' =&gt; \'&lt;span&gt;\',
                            \'link_after\'  =&gt; \'&lt;/span&gt;\',
                        ) );
                    ?&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .page-content --&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .portfolio --&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll need to create a &#8216;content-portfolio.php&#8217; template file so we know what portfolio item to grab. Create a new file and name it &#8216;content-portfolio.php&#8217;. Here is our code for the content file:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-php\" title=\"Content file for filter\">&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying Projects on index view
 *
 * @package wds-portfolio
 */
// get Jetpack Portfolio taxonomy terms for portfolio filtering
$terms = get_the_terms( $post-&gt;ID, \'jetpack-portfolio-type\' );
if ( $terms &amp;&amp; ! is_wp_error( $terms ) ) : 
    $filtering_links = array();
    foreach ( $terms as $term ) {
        $filtering_links[] = $term-&gt;slug;
    }
    $filtering = join( &quot;, &quot;, $filtering_links );
?&gt;
&lt;article id=&quot;post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;&quot; &lt;?php post_class( $filtering ); ?&gt;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;image-link&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;?php  if ( \'\' != get_the_post_thumbnail() ) : ?&gt;
                &lt;?php the_post_thumbnail( \'wds-portfolio-img\' ); ?&gt;
        &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;!-- #post-## --&gt;
&lt;?php
endif;</pre>
<p>What this code does is include the page content of whatever the page you create that uses this page template. We are also grabbing all content that is published with the <em>Portfolio Custom Content Type</em>.</p>
<p>The following sections are necessary for filtering our portfolio items.</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-html\" title=\"Filter items\">&lt;div class=&quot;portfolio-filter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li id=&quot;filter--all&quot; class=&quot;filter active&quot; data-filter=&quot;*&quot;&gt;&lt;?php _e( \'View All\', \'wds_portfolio\' ) ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;?php 
            // list terms in a given taxonomy
            $taxonomy = \'jetpack-portfolio-type\';
            $tax_terms = get_terms( $taxonomy );
            foreach ( $tax_terms as $tax_term ) {
            echo \'&lt;li class=&quot;filter&quot; data-filter=&quot;.\'. $tax_term-&gt;slug.\'&quot;&gt;\' . $tax_term-&gt;slug .\'&lt;/li&gt;\';
            }
        ?&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>The above code block grabs all taxonomy terms from the <em>Portfolio Custom Content Type</em> in a list. This will allow us to filter our portfolio items.</p>
<p>The next block of code will display our portfolio posts:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-html\" title=\"Portfolio items\">&lt;div class=&quot;portfolio&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    if ( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) ) :
        $paged = get_query_var( \'paged\' );
    elseif ( get_query_var( \'page\' ) ) :
        $paged = get_query_var( \'page\' );
    else :
        $paged = 1;
    endif;
    $posts_per_page = get_option( \'jetpack_portfolio_posts_per_page\', \'-1\' );
    $args = array(
        \'post_type\'      =&gt; \'jetpack-portfolio\',
        \'paged\'          =&gt; $paged,
        \'posts_per_page\' =&gt; $posts_per_page,
    );
    $project_query = new WP_Query ( $args );
    if ( post_type_exists( \'jetpack-portfolio\' ) &amp;&amp; $project_query -&gt; have_posts() ) :
        while ( $project_query -&gt; have_posts() ) : $project_query -&gt; the_post();
            get_template_part( \'content\', \'portfolio\' );
        endwhile;
        wds_portfolio_paging_nav( $project_query-&gt;max_num_pages );
        wp_reset_postdata();
    else :
?&gt;
    &lt;section class=&quot;no-results not-found&quot;&gt;
        &lt;header class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h1 class=&quot;page-title&quot;&gt;&lt;?php _e( \'No Project Found\', \'wds_portfolio\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .page-header --&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;page-content&quot;&gt;
            &lt;?php if ( current_user_can( \'publish_posts\' ) ) : ?&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;?php printf( __( \'Ready to publish your first project? &lt;a href=&quot;%1$s&quot;&gt;Get started here&lt;/a&gt;.\', \'wds_portfolio\' ), esc_url( admin_url( \'post-new.php?post_type=jetpack-portfolio\' ) ) ); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;?php else : ?&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;?php _e( \'It seems we can&amp;rsquo;t find what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. Perhaps searching can help.\', \'wds_portfolio\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .page-content --&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;&lt;!-- .no-results --&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .portfolio --&gt;</pre>
<p>The key to the above block are the class names. The &#8216;portfolio&#8217; class is being called in our wds-portfolio.js file. This tells our jQuery that all posts under this class are to be filtered.</p>
<p>The above code block also includes a specific query that grabs all posts from our &#8216;Portfolio Custom Content Type&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to add some styling. The following styling will cover the filter list items and your portfolio items. Feel free to adjust it to match the look of your website.</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint linenums lang-cs\" title=\"Styling portfolio items\">.portfolio-filter {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-size: 1.4rem;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
.portfolio-filter ul {
  margin: 0 0 2em;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
}
.portfolio-filter ul li {
  background: #f0f0f0;
  color: #999;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-block;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0 1em 1em 0;
  padding: .2em .5em;
  text-align: center;
}
.portfolio-filter ul li:first-child {
  margin-right: .8em;
}
.portfolio-filter ul li:focus, .portfolio-filter ul li:hover {
  color: #000;
}
.portfolio .type-jetpack-portfolio {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 -1px -1px 0;
  width: 100%;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  .portfolio .type-jetpack-portfolio {
    max-width: 100%;
    min-height: inherit;
  }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .portfolio .type-jetpack-portfolio {
    max-width: 239px;
    max-height: 180px;
  }
}
.portfolio .type-jetpack-portfolio img {
  display: block;
}
.portfolio .type-jetpack-portfolio:hover {
  background: #000;
  opacity: .6;
  transition: all .4s ease-in-out;
  -webkit-transition: all .4s ease-in-out;
  -moz-transition: all .4s ease-in-out;
  -o-transition: all .4s ease-in-out;
}</pre>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>
<p>Now that all code and files are added to our theme, let&#8217;s go back into our WordPress dashboard to start publishing items in our Portfolio Custom Content Type. When publishing a new portfolio, be sure to add &#8216;Project Types&#8217; to your posts. This will categorize your posts and your page will show the project types as fitlerable items&#8211;which will help in filtering your portfolio.</p>

<p>Everyone on the project wondered if there was some easy way that we could get a snapshot of what each install had going on. The only requirement that Chris wanted was an easy copy/paste way to get the cumulative status from each so he could compare side by side. This set my brain running and I was granted the task to explore what could be done to accomplish this.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-8852\"></span></p>
<p>After some research, I got set out on the task and the end result became &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Active-Plugin-Data\" target=\"_blank\">WDS Active Plugin Data</a>.&#8221; It is a multi-site dependent plugin that will only show up in the Network Admin settings submenu once activated.</p>
<h2>Views</h2>
<p>When you visit the settings page, you will be presented with a basic screen that provides three different view links at the top and the initial &#8220;Simple&#8221; view displayed below.</p>
<h3>Simple View</h3>
<p>With &#8220;Simple&#8221; view, you are presented with each plugin listed on their own line and their current status. Status is indicated by either blank space for not active, &#8220;[A]&#8221; for active, and &#8220;[NA]&#8221;&#8221; for network active right after the plugin name. This is all presented in a basic textarea that is non-editable and will auto-select all of the contents for easy copying.</p>
<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8854\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wds-active-plugin-data-simple.png\" alt=\"wds-active-plugin-data-simple\" /></p>
<h3>Advanced View</h3>
<p>While probably not THAT advanced, the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; view is not as compact in its listing compared to &#8220;Simple&#8221; view. It will list the plugins with two more columns for &#8220;Active&#8221; and &#8220;Network Active.&#8221; Each plugin will have its current status indicated by either &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221; in the corresponding column.</p>
<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8853\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wds-active-plugin-data-advanced.png\" alt=\"wds-active-plugin-data-advanced\" /></p>
<h3>Sites List View</h3>
<p>The last view we have is the &#8220;Sites List&#8221; view. With this one, we extrapolate the data and apply it to each site in the network. This will allow you to see which plugins are active in which sites, but does not denote status of &#8220;Network activation.&#8221; When the plugin is active for a site, its corresponding cell will be green with a checkmark in it, and when inactive, red with an x in it.</p>
<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8855\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wds-active-plugin-data-sites-list.png\" alt=\"wds-active-plugin-data-sites-list\" /></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>With the three available views, it is easy to see what plugins you have available, and where each is currently active. When working on client work, comparison of the status between development and production sites, or between two development sites is right at your fingertips.</p>
<p><em>You can find the plugin on our company <a href=\"http://www.github.com/WebDevStudios\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub page</a> at <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Active-Plugin-Data\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Active-Plugin-Data</a> or as a <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Active-Plugin-Data/archive/master.zip\" target=\"_blank\">direct zip file download</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>For those of you who aren’t familiar:</strong></p>
<p>PressNomics is a conference that was started by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/strebel\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua Strebel</a>, CEO of Page.ly, in an effort to create a space where the economics of WordPress could be discussed by the “who’s who” of WordPress business owners and innovators.</p>
<p>WDS has attended for the last few years, and our own <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dremeda\" target=\"_blank\">Dre Armeda</a> is known as “The Godfather” of PressNomics. After all, the idea for PressNomics was inspired by some good old-fashioned Skype brainstorming over whiskey and “Josh-tinis” (ingredients: top-secret) about what Joshua and Dre would like to see develop in the WordPress community. While Dre was focused on WordCamp San Diego, Joshua stepped forward to make their vision a reality, and PressNomics was born.</p>
<p>The first PressNomics started with a mere 125 attendees, but in a few short years, has grown dramatically. This next PressNomics is anticipating 270 WordPress minded folk to skill-share, network, and examine the industry that has been born of our favorite platform’s flexibility.</p>
<p>Will we see you there? If so, make sure to let us know! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba\" target=\"_blank\">Brad</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LisaSabinWilson\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa</a>, and Dre will be in attendance; be sure to say hi if you can! We’ve created a small resource guide below&#8211;here’s a few things you definitely don’t want to miss (oh, and a few places you’ll be able to track us down for that hello!):</p>
<p><span id=\"more-10478\"></span></p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY 11:25 AM 1/22: AN INTERVIEW WITH DRE (HOSTED BY JOSHUA STREBEL)</strong></p>
<p>You can call this your PressNomics equivalent of <i>Inside the Actors Studio</i>! The whole objective of PressNomics is to make it clear that, with enough passion and hard work, anyone can succeed in this business. Josh and Dre will be donning their smoking jackets and over a few glasses of scotch, will be discussing Dre’s trajectory in this world, from how the company Dre started, Sucuri, came about, why he walked away from that business, and what it meant for him to join WebDevStudios, amongst other things.</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY 1:30 PM 1/22: MICROSOFT RUNS MISSION CRITICAL WORDPRESS APPS ON AZURE. LEARN HOW YOU CAN TOO.</strong></p>
<p>Brad will be joining Yochay Kiriaty to discuss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/azure\" target=\"_blank\">Azure</a>, demonstrate how WebDevStudios helped Microsoft release code for the community, and demo how Microsoft sites run WordPress on Azure.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY 10:50 AM 1/23: THE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS PANEL</strong></p>
<p>Dre will be joining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syedbalkhi\" target=\"_blank\">Syed</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karimmarucchi\" target=\"_blank\">Karim</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jakemgold\" target=\"_blank\">Jake</a> to discuss mergers, acquisitions, and the climate of the WordPress industry as it matures. We are starting to see these a lot in our community, and it’s making for fascinating investments and developments, particularly in the bigger companies.</p>
<p>When is your business ready to be acquired? When are you in a position from a business perspective to acquire/merge with another organization? What does that look like? How does it work? How do you evaluate an organization&#8211;are they ready, do they serve your needs, does it make sense for everyone involved? How do you determine the payout and terms? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this panel, as well as discussing how the changes in the industry can benefit small business owners.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE ELSE CAN YOU FIND US? </strong></p>
<p><em>SATURDAY 1/24: GOLF</em></p>
<p>If there’s enough of an interest, too, we’d love to coordinate a happy hour at <a href=\"http://www.santanbrewing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">San Tan Brewing Company</a> . Shoot at tweet at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dremeda\" target=\"_blank\">Dre</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba\" target=\"_blank\">Brad</a> if you’d like to see this happen!</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL EVENTS</strong></p>
<p><a href=\"http://dradcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Dradcast</a> is hosting a very special LIVE podcast to kick off the weekend; Brad and Dre will be interviewing Lisa to talk about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lisa-Sabin-Wilson/e/B002BLY54I\" target=\"_blank\">her books</a> (two are dropping later this year), what PressNomics goodness they’re looking forward to, the <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2015/01/08/welcome-new-year-webdevstudios/\" target=\"_blank\">launch of WDS7</a>, and general WordPress business. Make sure to tune in tonight at 8 PM EST!</p>
<p><b>ONE LAST NOTE&#8230;</b></p>
<p>Dre will be live-tweeting from <a href=\"http://twitter.com/webdevstudios\" target=\"_blank\">@WebDevStudios</a>, so if you can&#8217;t attend PressNomics 2015 this year, you can still stay in the loop! Oh, and if you&#8217;re not looking to get inundated by tweets, make sure to mute the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pressnomics&amp;src=tyah\" target=\"_blank\">#PressNomics</a>.</p>

While there are a number of methods, determining which is best for you and your team is just a matter of coding style and personal preference.</p>
<p>Hands down, the greatest benefit from using inline media queries is the speed of writing and maintaining code. Imagine this scenario:</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario:</p>
<p><img class=\"size-full alignright wp-image-10261\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/not-inline-breakpoints-e1420357054763.png\" alt=\"a hot mess of sass breakpoint partials\" width=\"100\" />You need to make a change to the main navigation so you edit <code>nav.scss</code> only to wonder why you don&#8217;t see the changes you just made to the menu items. Taking another look at your sass partials, you realize you may have to edit some, or maybe all of these files in order for your change to display properly.</p>
<p>Inline media queries allows you to write and edit each selector in one place. This gives you a much better grasp on what every element is doing at any breakpoint.</p>
<p>The only downside is there isn&#8217;t an ideal way to intelligently combine media queries during post-processing. While there are some <a href=\"http://snugug.com/musings/target-your-css\">methods</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/frontendfriends/grunt-combine-mq\">tools</a> available, I think <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/241\">the issue</a> could use another resolution. On the other hand, leaving these inline media queries in your compiled CSS <a href=\"http://aaronjensen.github.io/media_query_test/\">does not seem to affect performance too much</a>.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-10260\"></span></p>
<h3>Method 1: A mixin that loops through all sizes</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the mixin called &#8220;wider-than&#8221;. Often times this mixin will have other names such as &#8220;bp&#8221;, &#8220;breakpoint&#8221;, or &#8220;mq.&#8221; I like calling it &#8220;wider-than&#8221; because when writing css it helps get my mind think mobile first. This is especially helpful if you&#8217;ve recently converted from max-width breakpoints. Instead of just code, it becomes a sentence: &#8220;Do this default thing, then if the screen is wider-than x, do this specific thing.&#8221; Keep in mind the &#8220;wider-than&#8221; name would not be clear if we did decide to add a max-width, orientation, or pretty much anything other than this basic min-width structure.</p>
<p>We also need to set the name and value for each breakpoint. In this example, I am generically using small, medium and large for our breakpoint names, but the names can be much more meaningful to the element or an action that takes place on the page.</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint Method 1a: A mixin that loops through all sizes\">// Loop through breakpoints with if/else statement
@mixin wider-than($point) {
    @if $point == large {
        @media screen and (min-width: 44em) { @content; }
    }
    @else if $point == medium {
        @media screen and (min-width: 34em) { @content; }
    }
    @else if $point == small {
        @media screen and (min-width: 24em) { @content; }
    }
    @else {
        @media screen and (min-width: $point) { @content; }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve set your breakpoint names and values, you can nest them within your selectors with an @include. The code below is changing the width and background color of the .primary selector based on the breakpoints that were set in the wider-than mixin.</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint Method 1b: A mixin that loops through all sizes\">.primary {
  background-color: $color-primary;
  width: 100%;
  @include wider-than(small) {
    background-color: $color-small;
    float: left;
    width: 55%;
  }
  @include wider-than(medium) {
    background-color: $color-medium;
    width: 65%;
  }
  @include wider-than(large) {
    background-color: $color-large;
    width: 75%;
  }
}</pre>

<h3>Method 2: Create Media Queries using Sass Maps</h3>
<p>This next example was inspired by a talk by Roy Tomeij presented at SassConf in 2014 called <em><a title=\"$lists: For Fun And Profit by Roy Tomeij\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/86306819\">$lists: For Fun And Profit</a></em>. In this video, he walks through a few ways to create a breakpoint mixin&#8211;the last of which is my favorite. I adopted his concept but went with a mobile first approach. <em>Minimum Requirement: Sass 3.3</em></p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint Method 2a: Create Media Queries using Sass Maps\">// Name and define our breakpoints
$breakpoints: (
  small: 30em,
  medium: 40em,
  large: 50em
);
@mixin wider-than($screen-size) {
    @if map-has-key($breakpoints, $screen-size) {
        @media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints, $screen-size)) {
            @content;
        }
    } @else {
        // Debugging
        @warn &quot;\'#{$screen-size}\' has not been declared as a breakpoint.&quot;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Then we would just write the media queries like we did in the previous example:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint Method 1b: A mixin that loops through all sizes\">.primary {
  background-color: $color-primary;
  width: 100%;
  @include wider-than(small) {
    background-color: $color-small;
    float: left;
    width: 55%;
  }
  @include wider-than(medium) {
    background-color: $color-medium;
    width: 65%;
  }
  @include wider-than(large) {
    background-color: $color-large;
    width: 75%;
  }
}</pre>
<p>And it would produce the same result:</p>
<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10427\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/breakpoint-sample2.gif\" alt=\"breakpoint methods sample 2\" width=\"840\" height=\"477\" /></p>
<p>This code takes advantage of the newer Sass Map feature which makes it easier to create breakpoints. Also, you will see the that we can add better error handling if a breakpoint name was not defined or mistyped.</p>

<p><em>See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/stacy/pen/zxoEPO/\">Nested Media Queries using Sass Data Maps</a> by Stacy (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/stacy\">@stacy</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Method 3: Breakpoint Sass</h3>
<p>The first time I looked into <a title=\"Breakpoint Sass\" href=\"http://breakpoint-sass.com/\">Breakpoint Sass</a> I thought, “Eh, we already have a pretty good solution,&#8221; but when I actually <a title=\"Sass Bites - Mason Wendell and Breakpoint\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR9lK_K8MDE\">saw it in action</a> I quickly changed my mind. The ability to pass multiple contextual values to each breakpoint is very useful and declaring them is even easier than the previous two examples:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint Method 3: Breakpoint\">// min-width is default when only a number is declared
$small: 500px;
// if two numbers are listed, then it assumes the first number is min-width and second is max-width
$medium: 600px 900px;
// if one value is a string, assume a feature/value pair
$large: max-width 1280px;
// string tests together within parentheses, assume each item is a feature value pair
$tall-height: (min-height 1000px) (orientation portrait);</pre>
<p>You would @include these breakpoints in your partials using <code>@include breakpoint(name-of-breakpoint)</code>:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint Mixin @include\">.primary {
  width: 100%;
  @include breakpoint(small) {
    width: 55%;
  }
  @include breakpoint(medium) {
    width: 65%;
  }
  @include breakpoint(large) {
    width: 75%;
  }
}</pre>
<p>Or better yet, using more contextual names based on what happens at the requested sizes:</p>
<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"Breakpoint - more contextual names\">$mobile-menu: max-width 699px;
$full-menu: 700px;
.primary {
  width: 100%;
  @include breakpoint($mobile-menu) {
    width: 50%;
  }
  @include breakpoint($full-menu) {
    width: 65%;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Breakpoint&#8217;s control over media query values is very powerful but one of my favorite features is something really basic. If you set <code>$breakpoint-to-ems: true;</code> then it will convert the pixel value you enter to ems!</p>

<p class=\"sassmeister\"><a href=\"http://sassmeister.com/gist/5e00dd556bf52e442ac1\">I highly recommend going to this SassMeister Gist </a> to see the scss and compiled CSS in action.</p>
<p>Breakpoint also has more advanced features like <a title=\"No Query Fallbacks\" href=\"https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/No-Query-Fallbacks#separate-fallback-file\">No Query Fallbacks</a> and<br />
<a href=\"https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/Breakpoint-Context\">Context Queries</a>.</p>
<p>I have also been playing with <a title=\"Singularity Grid System\" href=\"https://github.com/at-import/Singularity\">Singularity</a> as a semantic grid system which relies on Breakpoint for media queries.</p>
<p>Have you tried Breakpoint or Singularity on a project? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Note: Breakpoint 2.2.x requires Sass 3.3.0 and Compass 1.0.0.alpha.13 or higher.</em></p>

It has amassed over 640,000 downloads and maintains a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p>Since its initial release, it has largely maintained the same user interface and has only had minor tweaks through its evolution. However, that consistency meant it hasn&#8217;t kept up with the evolution of the WordPress admin since the days of WordPress 3.0, including the huge change from WordPress 3.8.</p>
<p><strong>As a result, I wanted to give the </strong>the plugin<strong> a UI overhaul for the next major release, and I hope the new version provides a better, more easy to use user experience for our existing and future users.</strong> I also used it as a chance to refactor the existing code and make it more maintainable and customizable by 3rd parties. Everyone wins!</p>
<p>However, I need beta testers to make sure the upgrade goes smoothly and no settings are lost in the transition from 0.8.5 to 0.9.0. I also need new users to make sure it&#8217;s usable and not confusing.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s where YOU come in!</strong></p>
<p>Things I need tested by both current and new users include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seemless migration from 0.8.x to 0.9.0. No behavior lost. The migration will be automatic, but making sure the provided settings match in the new UI needs to be checked.</li>
<li>If you have existing post types or taxonomies registered by CPTUI 0.8.x, check that their behavior remains as it was before.</li>
<li>Importing and exporting between sites using 0.9.0. This will be one of the new menu items available, and all of the data should be provided for you automatically&#8211;you just need to have a post type or taxonomy set up on one site, and not on another before clicking import.</li>
<li>Get code functionality. This one should be familiar to you already from the previous versions, but we need it to provide all of the expected values when set, and not empty values when not set.</li>
<li>General usability of the new UI. Is it more clear how to do things? Worse?</li>
<li>If you have multisite, that needs a really good tire kick that I will be doing myself as well soon.</li>
<li>Any bugs you find.</li>
<li>Translation updates, if you&#8217;re fluent in more than one language.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id=\"more-10395\"></span></p>
<h3>How to beta test the new version</h3>
<p>A dev site copy of an existing site or a localhost setup would be ideal for this. Version 0.9.0 preserves the original settings in the options table, so it will be possible to downgrade if necessary, but it&#8217;s still better to not test on production if everything is critical.</p>
<p>To acquire a copy of the beta version, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui/archive/dev.zip\">download</a> a zip of the dev branch from GitHub and upload or save it to your plugins folder on the intended site.</p>
<p>If you have 0.8.x already and want to retain those files, just make sure the beta copy has a different folder name. After that, deactivate the current version before activating the new version. It will show up as a &#8220;duplicate&#8221; listing in your plugins admin screen.</p>
<p>If you are not upgrading from a previous version, simply put the folder in your plugins directory and activate like usual.</p>
<h3>How to submit feedback</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;re ready to submit feedback, you can do it in a couple of ways:</p>
<p>The first way will be through <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-post-type-ui\">the Custom Post Type UI support forum</a>. Simply start a forum topic and preface the thread that it&#8217;s a feedback post for 0.9.0. I monitor the forum regularly, so your feedback won&#8217;t go missed!</p>
<p>The second way, if you prefer, would be to simply email the feedback to me at <a href=\"mailto:michael@webdevstudios.com\" target=\"_blank\">michael@webdevstudios.com</a>.</p>
<p>Any feedback from you, our plugin users, would be much appreciated!</p>
